            The Arabica coffee beans sorter is a sophisticated machine designed
            to separate coffee beans based on their size, quality, and color.
            This sorting process is essential to remove defective or damaged
            beans, foreign materials, and any other impurities that might have
            been mixed with the coffee cherries during harvesting or processing.

            The sorter uses advanced technology, such as high maginification
            camera, to identify and categorize the beans accurately. As the
            coffee beans pass through the machine, the cameras detect variations
            in size, color, and quality, and based on predetermined criteria,
            the machine sorts the beans into different grades or quality levels.
            This ensures that only the highest-quality beans are used for
            roasting and brewing, while lower-grade beans can be used for other
            purposes or blends.

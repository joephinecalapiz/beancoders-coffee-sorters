# The Arabica Coffee Beans Sorter



The Arabica coffee beans sorter is a sophisticated machine designed to separate coffee beans based on their size, quality, and color. This sorting process is essential to remove defective or damaged beans, foreign materials, and any other impurities that might have been mixed with the coffee cherries during harvesting or processing.

The sorter uses advanced technology, such as a high-magnification camera, to identify and categorize the beans accurately. As the coffee beans pass through the machine, the cameras detect variations in size, color, and quality, and based on predetermined criteria, the machine sorts the beans into different grades or quality levels. This ensures that only the highest-quality beans are used for roasting and brewing, while lower-grade beans can be used for other purposes or blends.

Upgrade sorter for the better, coffee will make it tastier!
